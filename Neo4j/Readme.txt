To create data in Neo4j we need the nodes and relationship. 
In this part I try to find the relation between “Abadal, Baltaser” and "A. Martin, Mitchell”


From PostgreSql extracted the below data
Movie Titles 
Relationship between directores and movies 
Relationship between actors and movies 

"Load" file is used to load the data into Neo4j which created nodes and relationships between nodes. 
"Query" file is used to query out the shortest path between the two presons.
